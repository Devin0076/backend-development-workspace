# Backend Development Workspace

**Author:** Devin

This repository is my personal backend development workspace for the course.  
It will track my projects, notes, resources, and progress as I build toward a final REST API.

## Questions
### 1) What is this workspace?
A centralized, version-controlled place for all backend work (projects, notes, references, and experiments).

### 2) Why does version control matter (Knight Capital lesson)?
Reliable workflows prevent disasters caused by stale code, manual steps, and missing safeguards.  
I’ll use Git branches, clear commits, and reviews to avoid “old code in prod”.

### 3) What are my learning objectives?
- Become fluent with Git (branches, commits, merges, PRs).
- Build backend scripting skills and automation.
- Design and document RESTful APIs with tests.
- Maintain professional documentation and commit hygiene.

### 4) How will I use this repo this semester?
- Organize each unit in its own folder with a `README.md`.
- Keep a `learning-log.md` updated after each session.
- Maintain a personal `git-reference.md` for common commands.
- Store curated links in `resources.md` as my go-to reference.
